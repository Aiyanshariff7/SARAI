# ðŸš¨SARAI
SARAI (Smart Assistive Response AI) is an AI-powered emergency call handling system that automates the process of receiving, analyzing, and prioritizing distress calls. It uses speech-to-text transcription, natural language processing (NLP), and keyword-based emergency grading to assess urgency in real time.

Twilio Voice: Receives incoming emergency calls and records user responses.

AssemblyAI: Transcribes recorded voice messages into text.

OpenAI GPT: Analyzes transcribed text to extract emergency details like name, location, type, and urgency.

MySQL (via XAMPP): Stores structured emergency call records.

Web3.py + Ethereum: Logs operations on a smart contract for traceability (optional).
