# SARAI
SARAI (Smart Assistive Response AI) is an AI-powered emergency call handling system that automates the process of receiving, analyzing, and prioritizing distress calls. It uses speech-to-text transcription, natural language processing (NLP), and keyword-based emergency grading to assess urgency in real time.
